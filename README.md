## Overview

This repository implements temporal reasoning capabilities for vision-language models in simulated embodied environments, addressing the critical limitation of frame-by-frame processing in current multimodal AI systems.The field of embodied artificial intelligence stands at a critical juncture. While current vision-language models like LLaVA (Large Language and Vision Assistant) have achieved remarkable success in static image understanding, they face significant limitations when deployed in dynamic, real-world environments where temporal reasoning is essential. This research addresses a fundamental gap: how can we augment vision-language models with temporal reasoning capabilities to enable more sophisticated embodied AI systems?

### The Challenge: Beyond Static Understanding
Current vision-language models like LLaVA excel at static image interpretation but fail in embodied AI scenarios requiring sequential task execution. This research develops systematic temporal reasoning integration.Current multimodal AI systems excel at analyzing individual images and answering questions about static scenes. However, embodied agents operating in real environments must understand temporal sequences, track objects across time, predict future states, and make decisions based on historical context. This temporal blindness represents a critical bottleneck for practical embodied AI applications.
Consider a household robot tasked with "finding the keys that were left on the kitchen counter earlier." Current vision-language models can identify keys and counters in individual frames but cannot maintain temporal context about where objects were previously located or how scenes have changed over time. This limitation severely constrains their utility in real-world scenarios.

### Research Objectives
This research proposal aims to develop Temporal LLaVA Habitat, a novel framework that integrates temporal reasoning capabilities into vision-language models for embodied AI applications. The key objectives include:
### 1. Temporal Memory Integration
Developing architectures that can maintain and reason over temporal sequences of visual observations, enabling models to understand how scenes evolve over time.
### 2. Multi-Scale Temporal Reasoning
Implementing mechanisms to handle different temporal scales - from immediate frame-to-frame changes to long-term behavioral patterns and environmental dynamics.
### 3.Embodied Task Performance
Validating the approach on realistic embodied AI tasks in simulated environments, demonstrating improved performance on temporally-dependent challenges.
