# üß≠ Embodied Temporal Reasoning
*A Proof of Concept for Vision-Language Models with Temporal Intelligence*  

---

Welcome to the official project page of **Embodied Temporal Reasoning**, a research proof-of-concept that augments vision-language models with **temporal reasoning** in simulated environments using [Habitat-Sim](https://github.com/facebookresearch/habitat-sim).  

Instead of simply answering *what is seen now*, our models track **what has been seen before** and **what needs to be done next**.
