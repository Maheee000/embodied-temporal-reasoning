# üåç Overview  

Current **vision-language models** like LLaVA excel at static image interpretation but fail in **embodied AI scenarios** requiring sequential task execution.  

This project introduces **temporal reasoning capabilities** for embodied AI using [Habitat-Sim](https://github.com/facebookresearch/habitat-sim).

## The Challenge: Beyond Static Understanding  

Multimodal AI systems can answer questions about single frames, but **real-world agents** must:  
- Understand **temporal sequences**  
- Track **objects across frames**  
- Predict **future states**  
- Use **historical context** for decision-making  

This project shows how **temporal reasoning unlocks new capabilities** in embodied agents.
